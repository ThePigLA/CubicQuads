# CubicQuads
A repository for work on immersing 8-vertex cubic graphs into quad meshes

Files:

KnownCubics.txt - A file with the edge list of all known cubic graphs on 8-vertices with titles supplied by Vance.

CQsWithoutRadials.txt - This is a list of all the interesting CQs that we have discovered (without their radials).  The first graphs -- all CQs with up to 22 vertices -- were generated with nauty.  

After that, we have the CQs generated by the cut-and-paste method.  We only store the ones whose underlying cubic graph was "new" at the time of its generation.  You can distinguish between these graphs from the ones generated by nauty because they have vertex indices >= 1000.

identifyCQsAndRadials.py - is a messy python script that reads from the KnownCubics.txt file and the CQsWithoutRadials.txt file.  For each CQ in the CQWithoutRadials.txt file, it extracts the underlying cubic graph, looks for an isomorphic copy in KnownCubics, and prints out the title if there is a match.  It then does the same thing for the radial of that CQ.  Finally, it enumerates the titles of the cubics in KnownCubics for which we have not discovered an immersing CQ.
